				<p>I enrolled in a computer engineering undergraduate programme in 2011 from which I successfully graduated in September, 2014. 
					The Faculty curriculum consists of lectures, auditory, laboratory, and design exercises.
					<br><br>Some of the classes that I have attended are Programming I & II, Object Oriented Programming, Algorithms and Data Structures,
					Digital Electronics, Information Theory, Computer Architecture, etc.
					<br><br>Through the undergraduate programme I had a chance to learn certain programming languages, more specifically C, C++, and C#. 
					Also, I had an opportunity to work with Field Programmable Gate Array - Spartan 3 and Pegasus, which uses VHDL - description language 
					for circuit design.
					<br><br>As of February 2015 I am officially a Bachelor of Computer Engineering. Currently I am attending the graduate programme
					and working on my Masters Degree in computer engineering.

				<p>With the start of the first semester classes became more interesting. Once again I had to work with <abbr title="Field Programmable Gate Array">FPGA</abbr>
					as part of the laboratory exercises for Computer System Design class.<br><br>The most memorable class from the first semester was, 
					without a doubt, Discrete Mathematics - which introduced a refreshing, fun side of mathematics to me.<br><br>As for the second 
					semester, which I am currently in, most classes I attend are very interesting and a lot of fun. Internet Programming peaked my 
					interest in front-end development and Data Visualization introduced me to interesting new methods of displaying data.
